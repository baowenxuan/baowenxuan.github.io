Hi! My name is Wenxuan Bao (鲍文轩 in Chinese). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science (previously Department of Computer Science) at the <a href='https://illinois.edu/'>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a>. I am in the <a href='https://isail-laboratory.github.io/'>iSAIL Lab</a> and my advisor is <a href='https://www.hejingrui.org/'>Prof. Jingrui He</a>. Before that, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Automation and a Minor in Statistics at <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Tsinghua University</a>. 

**Research interests**: My research interests include transfer learning and trustworthy federated learning, etc. I am interested in transferring knowledge from multiple different domains, e.g., data sources, users, tasks, etc. 

*I am currently seeking research-oriented full-time jobs opportunities for 2025. Please contact me if you have any recruitment openings.*
