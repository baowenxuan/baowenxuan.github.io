Hi! My name is Wenxuan Bao (鲍文轩 in Chinese). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href='https://illinois.edu/'>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)</a>. I am in the <a href='https://isail-laboratory.github.io/'>iSAIL Lab</a> and my supervisor is <a href='https://www.hejingrui.org/'>Prof. Jingrui He</a>. Before that, I earned my B.Eng. degree in Automation and a Minor in Statistics at <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/'>Tsinghua University</a>. 

**Research interests**: My research interests include federated learning, transfer learning, adversarial robustness, etc. 

*I am currently seeking research-oriented internship opportunities for the summer of 2024. Please contact me if you have any recruitment openings.*
