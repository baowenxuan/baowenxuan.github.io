## Paper Summary

We propose FedCollab to alleviate the negative transfer problem in federated learning by clustering clients into non-overlapping coalitions based on their distribution distances and data quantities. 
<!-- 
- Theory: We analyze how clustered FL performance is affected by two key factors: distribution distance and data quantity.
- Algorithm: We propose FedCollab to solve for the best collaboration structure.
- Extensive experiments: We test FedCollab under label shift, feature shift and concept shift with various models / datasets.  -->

<!-- ## Introduction

We consider a FL system with $N$ clients $1, \cdots, N$ connected to a central server. 

## Method


## Result
